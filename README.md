## Introduction
[View live project here](….)
![Site MockUp](./documentation/mockup.png)

This is the fourth and final project designed to exhibit my capabilities and skills in Javascript, Python and Django as a student
of Code Institute. (https://codeinstitute.net/)
The goal was to showcase my skills to potential employers/recruiters, on a topic that I'm deeply interested in.

This project is a complete circle for me, I selected to re-build my first milestone project using the new skills, languages and learning since its initial production. The website for Teifi Taekwondo outside of the club's social media (inks to which are found within the footer). It is designed for the purposes of furthering the clubs reach, enhanced marketing with the goal of recruiting more students to the classes offered at the club, additionally with the need for a “new normal” since the start of the pandemic and the return of clubs like Teifi Taekwondo post lockdowns going Cashless and making all members pay for sessions, and when necessary equipment. As a result of this my website allows users to view a selection of classes, and products. Upon creating a 
profile users will be able to purchase these therefore registering them with classes. It is designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices, with simple navigation for prospective and current students and their parent/guardians.

Teifi Taekwondo is a fictional club based in St Dogmaels, Cardigan and is located on the banks of the River Teifi



The website is easy to navigate through with a selection of dropdown menus and a search bar, within the fixed header, that are visible on every page.
My website contains a landing page, complete with headline image and links to the other main pages of the site. Login and Register links are easily accessible
via the My Account dropdown and contain easy to use forms that can be used to gain access to all parts of the site open for the public.
Superusers will have access to the Management pages that allow them the option to add and Edit/Delete them as required.

A link to my website can be found [here]()

## UX

### Goals -

The purpose of the site is to provide a simple, straightforward format presenting information about Teifi Taekwondo, with the added option of being able to 
purchase the sessions and various equipment via a secure checkout. The website is designed for people interested in Taekwondo and considering taking up the sport and joining the club. 
The website is fully functional and interactive giving the user a positive experience as they move through the pages, with thorough explanations in regards to the forms
necessary within.
I focused on a design that would be clear and engaging, with positive user experiences so users would be more inclined to make consistent use of the site.
The features implemented within the site have been carefully considered, with the users needs and business needs both taking an equal priority in the design and execution process.

### Wireframes -

I have produced a mock up of the websites pages. You can view them [WIREFRAMES.md](./WIREFRAMES.md)

### Design -

#### Colour Palette -


The colour scheme throughout the site was kept neutral, in keeping with the tone of the site, and allowed for the images to stand out drawing the user in with their bold colours.
The colours of the website are primarily white and black, symbols of the progress in Taekwondo. Alongside this for colour we have used a red and blue, traditional colour of competitors in competition. The four colours represent the colours of the flag of South Korea, the county from which originates Taekwondo from.
When choosing supplemental colours for both the Tigers (and family fight pass) and Ladies classes I opted to keep within concepts linked to both Tigers and ladies. Pink is commonly associated with female products when looking at equipment in combat sports – Pink colours are regularly found in Gloves, Uniforms, Protection. Whilst Tigers are predominantly orange, neither International Taekwondo Federation (ITF) or World Taekwondo (WT) use orange as a belt through progression to Black belt. Therefore, to balance the use of primary colours Red and Blue, with reference to the colours found in the GUP belt system I opted to use yellow.
- Red - # - This red is the same Hexcode used in Teifi Taekwondo’s logo
- Blue - #4682B4 - This is the same Hexcode used in Teifi Taekwondo’s logo 
- Yellow - #F3E016 - This is the same Hexcode used in Teifi Taekwondo’s Family Fight pass logo. This colour is only seen by Admin and is specific for Admin Tasks such as editing project information.
- Pink - #FF6BAC - This is the same Hexcode used in Teifi Taekwondo’s ladies logo
- Black and White - #000000, #FFFFFF respectfully are set via Bootstrap CSS

I tried to appeal to the tastes of the users when contemplating the colour scheme of the site, and with the target audience in mind, 
kept the decoration to a minimum and opted for a clean, fresh colour scheme to match the layout, with neutral colours to add a warm overtone and the occasional pop of colour to identify difference in classes and information.

#### Font -

"Poppins" - Poppins is a clear legible font.

## User Stories

### Target Audience -

The target audience will consist primarily of parents looking for martial arts clubs for their children, alongside adults looking for a new adventure and fitness programme. The products can be purchased from the comfort of your own home and collected from classes attended.
The site has a range of information which explains the differences in classes, and the Frequently Asked Questions which new members ask within the classes pages. 
Site superusers will appreciate the ease and simplicity behind the running and maintenance of the site, with user friendly aspects for the
general public and themselves, with regards to adding/editing and deleting content of the store- this can come in handy with the addition of more personal equipment needed as students’ progress and the club looks to diversify product ranges in the future with water bottles, additional clothing designs and the addition of products like tracksuits for competitions, alongside fees required for attendance and participation in competitions.
With the Pandemic’s effect still being felt, many clubs have gone cashless asking students to register and purchase memberships and session fees online. The aim of the shop is to carryout this process for both students, their guardians (where appropriate)and the club itself. 
Site security will appeal to every member of the target audience. When using the secure checkout functions in place, users will feel comfortable and confident that their data is being used confidentially.

### Features left to Implement -

- _400 and 500 Error Pages_ - A page that has the message of the error and 'Back to Home' button so that the user would not be lost.

- _Confirm Deletion Modal_ - Pop up that asks the user for confirmation before deleting products.

- _Colour_ - The ability to select products with both Size and Colour. Some items in the products have the ‘_has_colour’ already listed. But was not implemented due to time confidence and inexperience.

- _Refunds_ - The ability to issue refunds through the website.

- _Store Customer Card information_ - Use stripe to store the customers card information for future purchases.

- _Social Media Login_ - Allow users to login via social media accounts.

- _Alternative Payment Method_ - Add Google and Apple pay.

- _Order Tracking System_ - To keep the customers informed with the status of their purchase, it would be nice if the site provides the order status such as shipment information in order history and email notifications.

- _Student Tracking System_ - Majority of younger students won’t have access to a card that will allow them to make purchases, with the vast majority of users therefore being their parents (or guardians) by adding notes style text fields into the checkout for details such as student names for session fees, memberships and gradings, with grading information going further to include the current belt of the students. This could further be added to the profile with a place being kept to store student names and belt ranks in situations like this.

- _Learn Pages_ - For some potential users they may want further detail on the learning which occurs in the club with syllabus, belt order etc.

- _Categories In Blogs_ Add ways for users to see specific categories for the blog so that those looking for information regarding Gradings aren't surrounded out by posts concerning general club admin or competitions.

- _Comments In Blogs_ With the Addition of the blog the addition of a comment section would create opportunities for users and admin to relate information back and forth- ForExample in the blog there is a post dedicated to getting information surrounding intreset for an "In-House Competition" The post asks for users to discuss this with instructors- by having the comment section this would enable users who are interested to provide immediate feed back. Additionally with Good luck and Congratulation posts regarding gradings and competitions it would be an opportunity fo users to support fellow members of as they test and compete, fostering a greater sense of community within the club.

- _Likes In Blogs_ This would enable owners to see imediate response from users on their posts. It could be used as a straw poll when the club raises questions.

### Bugs and Fixes Implemented after Testing -
- Following feedback an error and typo in CSS meant that the image picker used in editing and creating products overflew and preventing the use of the form.

## Testing

I carried our substantial testing on all of my apps pages and links. You can see the results of the tests [TESTING.MD](./TESTING.md)

### Validation of Code Testing -

#### HTML - 

All Pages tested using [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/nu/) HTML Validator.

No warnings or Errors.

#### CSS -

All Pages tested using [W3C](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) CSS Validator.

No warnings or Errors.

#### Javascript -

All JS and JQuery tested using [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) Javascript Validator.

No Errors.

#### Python -

All Python tested using [PEP8](http://pep8online.com/) Python Validator.

No warnings or Errors.

> Note: I ran ``` python3 -m flake8 ``` and fixed all the errors and warnings associated with my own code.
I left line to long errors within the code generated by Django and code from the migrations as developers shouldn't need to touch them.
Errors left within my own code are

> Pylint errors ( ''  has no 'object' member )

> Doctype Errors ( Doctype must be declared first ); As my html files extend from the base.html file and the doctype is declared there, it doesn't need to be repeated on every page.

> Html Hint errors ( Special Characters Must Be Escaped ); The character is escaped but the linter can't tell as there's python in the line of code.

> Cornflakes ('checkout.signals' imported but unused); This allows the Admin to see the order total, grand total and delivery cost in Admin Page.

> Cornflakes ('avoid using null=True'); This is what the webhook handler looks for in my own form to stop it creating another order.

## Deployment

This website was developed in Gitpod and pushed to the remote repositories, GitHub and Heroku. The live page is hosted on Heroku.

### Used Commands during Deployment -

1. git add . - To add files to staging area.

2. git commit -m "message here" - To commit the files.

3. git push - To push the committed files to the origin master branch on github.

4. git push heroku master - To push the committed files to the origin master branch on heroku.

5. git status - To see the current state of the files.

6. python3 manage.py migrate - Runs migrations.

7. python3 manage.py create superuser - Creates Superuser.

8. python3 manage.py dumpdata - To create json data files.

9. export DATABASE_URL= "your value from heroku" - To connect Gitpod to Postgres.

10. python3 manage.py loaddata - Loads the dumps into Postgres.

### Hosting on Heroku -

In order to successfully deploy the app, the following steps were taken:

1. Log into your Heroku account, create new app.

2. Choose app name and closest region.

3. On Resources tab, provision Heroku Postgres.
	 
4. Back in gitpod, install the following via these commands:
	- ```pip3 install dj database url```
	- ```pip3 install psycopg2 binary```

5. Freeze the requirements to update the requirements.txt file. This makes sure Heroku installs all apps when deployed:
	- ```pip3 freeze > requirements.txt```

6. To get the database setup, go to settings.py and import dj_database_url.

7. In databases settings, comment out default configuration and replace the default database with a call to dj_database_url.parse, and give it the database URL from Heroku stored in your config variables (under the app settings tab).

8. Now run all migrations with:
    - ```python 3 manage.py migrate```

9. Then create a superuser with:
	- ```python3 manage.py create superuser```

10.	Back in settings.py remove the Heroku database config, and uncomment the original so our database URL doesn't end up in version control.

11.	Then commit to github.

12.	Using an if statement in settings.py, to allow access to Postgres when running on Heroku, where database URL environment variable is defined, otherwise connecting to sqlite. 

13. Install unicorn, which will act as our webserver, then freeze that into requirements.txt:
	- ```pip3 install gunicorn```
	- ```pip3 freeze > requirements.txt```

14.	Create Procfile, enter the following to tell Heroku to create a web dyno, which will run unicorn and serve our django app:
	- ```web: gunicorn APP_NAME.wsgi:application```

15. Temporarily disable collectstatic. 

16.	Add the hostname of our Heroku app to allowed hosts in settings.py, and localhost:
	- ```ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['YOUR-APP-NAME.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']```

17.	Add/commit changes to github.

18.	To deploy to Heroku, enter (you may need to initialize your Heroku git remote if you created your app on the website rather than the CLI):
    - ```git push heroku master```

19.	To automatically deploy on Heroku when committing to github - on your Heroku dashboard go to Deploy > Github, search for your repository and click Connect.

20.	Click Enable Automatic Deploys.

21.	Add a new secret key in your Heroku Config Vars (you can use an online Django secret key generator to do this). 

22.	Now you can replace the secret key in settings.py with a call to get this from the environment.

23.	Commit/push these changes to github.

### AWS -

AWS is a cloud based storage service, used to store static files and images:

1. After creating an AWS account (using the free version will be sufficient), access the AWS management console in your account.

2. Find s3 by searching for this in services.

3. Open s3 and create a new bucket.

4. Enter a name for your bucket/select your closest region.

5. Uncheck the block public access box, and create the bucket.

6. Once created, click on the bucket and enter the following settings:
    - Under Properties, turn on static website hosting
	-  Under Permissions, paste in the CORS configuration:
        ```
            [
                {
                    "AllowedHeaders": [
                        "Authorization"
                        ],
                    "AllowedMethods": [
                        "GET"
                        ],
                    "AllowedOrigins": [
                        "*"
                        ],
                    "ExposeHeaders": []
                }
            ] 
        ```
    - Go to the bucket policy tab and select, policy generator to create a security policy for this bucket.
    - The policy type is going to be s3 bucket policy, allow all principals by using a star, and the action will be, get object.
    - Copy the ARN (Amazon resource name) from the bucket policy tab and paste it into the ARN box at the bottom, then click Add Statement. Click Generate Policy then copy this policy into the bucket policy editor.
    - Before clicking Save, you want to allow access to all resources in this bucket, add a slash star onto the end of the resource key to do this.
    - Go to the access control list tab and set the list objects permission for everyone under the Public Access section.

7. With the s3 bucket set up, you need to create a user to access it. Do this through a service called Iam (Identity and Access Management).

8. Go back to the services menu and open Iam.

9. Click groups and create a new group (keep clicking through to Create Group).

10. Create the policy used to access the bucket by clicking policies, and then create policy.

11.	Go to the JSON tab and select import managed policy, then search for s3 and import the s3 full access policy.

12.	Get the bucket ARN from the bucket policy page in s3, and paste that in the JSON section.

13.	Click review policy, give it a name and a description, and click create policy.

14.	Attach the policy to the group we created. Go to groups, click manage my group, click attach policy, search for the policy just created and select it, then click attach policy.

15.	Create a user to put in the group. On the user's page, click add user, create a user, give them programmatic access, then select next.

16.	Add user to your group. Important: Download the CSV file which contains this users access key and secret access key. This is needed to authenticate them from our Django app (you cannot access this again!).

17.	To Connect Django to s3 bucket, Install 2 new packages:
    -	```pip3 install boto3```
    -	```pip3 install django-storages```

18.	Freeze requirements:
    -	```pip3 freeze > requirements.txt```

19.	Add ‘storages’ to installed apps on settings.py.

20.	To connect Django to s3. In settings.py add the required statements to tell it which bucket it should be communicating with.
 
21.	Go to Heroku and add AWS keys to config variables. Add USE_AWS = True to config vars too.

22.	Remove disable collectstatic variable.

23.	In settings,py, add required statements to tell django where the static files will be coming from in production.

24.	Create a file called custom storages.
 
25.	In settings.py, state that for static file storage you want to use the storage class you just created, and give it the location. Do the same thing for media files by using the default file storage and media files location settings. 

26.	Add/commit changes in github.

### Forking the GitHub Repository -

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original 
repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)

2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.

3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Running this Project Locally -

You will need to install the following to run this locally:

- An IDE 
- Python3 to run the application
- PIP to install all app requirements
- Django
- SQlite or Postgres Databases
- GIT for cloning and version control

To run this code on your local machine, you would go to my respository at
https://github.com/tloveday/MS4 and on the home page on the right hand side just above all the files, you will see a green button that says,
"Clone or download", this button will give you options to clone with HTTPS, open in desktop or download as a zip file.
To continue with cloning, you would;

- Open Git Bash
- Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
- Type git clone, and then paste this URL; https://github.com/tloveday/MS4.git Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

### Final Thoughts - 
This project was a labour of love, particularly as I chose to use my initial learning as its springboard. I wanted to show myself how much I had learned by re-packaging the topic of my first milestone project into my final. Unfortunately, the project was started in a season of both uncertainty and festivities and with a young family and the threat and executions of school lockdowns and home/remote learning became a secondary to everything. I have sat through hours of youtube tutorials, slack channels, stack questions on top of multiple re-watches of the entire modules leading into the project. I have however learnt from mistakes made in previous projects, spending significantly less time looking at singular problems in isolation, researching and then turning to guidance from my sources available including but not limited to, my Hackathon team and mentor.  Whilst this may not be perfect or as I originally wanted and intended but it is the best that I can currently provide with my limited experience. The deployed and submitted project alongside the completion of the course at Code institute is a personal triumph for myself and the last 12 months starting the course in a Carpark awaiting the birth of my daughter, house move and the continual uncertainty of Covid-19 has made me realise I am capable, I can deliver - it might take me a little longer on occasion- but I can get it done. As WarwickZero, Vehlr and their twitch communities have continually reminded me… “You got this Pan” (Pan being part of the username CaptainPan I go by.)
